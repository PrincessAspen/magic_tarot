                <h1>My name is Aspen Phoenix Berry</h1>
                <h2>I was born in Irmo, South Carolina to a Christian family. When I was eighteen, I found wicca and started practicing tarot for the first time. I still remember the little book that came in the box with my first set of cards, and the even littler book that I wrote spells and reading results in. Spirituality is really important to me, so when I was prompted to make a magic eight ball I immediately fell in love with the idea of doing tarot instead. Though I only included the twenty-two major arcana in this reading, my favorite card was always the Knight of Swords. It represents quickness of thought and action, but also an overzealous haste that ignores any hazards in one's path. Out of the major arcana, it's definitely the Hanged Man. It represents uncertainty, and the need to make sacrifices in order to move forward. I hope that by sharing my faith, I can help other people move forward in their lives.</h2>
